# Titanic Casualty Prediction
The dataset for this project is taken from kaggle. Also the solution is implemented by taking guidance from kaggle.
There are two techniques used in this :
# 1) Logistic Regression
# 2) Decision trees
There is feature engineering done in this solution. The output for both the above mentioned algorithms is visible before and after feature engineering.
